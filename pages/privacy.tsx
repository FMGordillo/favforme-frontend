        COMPANY is committed to safeguarding the information you entrust to
        COMPANY and believes that every User should know how it utilizes the
        information collected from Users. &nbsp;Please note that the Site may
        contain links to other web sites, and the Site allows Users to download
        or otherwise access Content (including software), controlled by third
        parties. &nbsp;COMPANY is not responsible for the privacy practices of
        these or any other web sites or Content controlled by third parties, and
        you access and utilize such Content and web sites entirely at your own
        risk. &nbsp;COMPANY recommends that you review the privacy and other

      <span>
        COMPANY is based, and this web site is hosted, in the United States of
        America. &nbsp;If you are from the European Union, Canada or other
        regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that
        may differ from U.S. law and you are registering an account on the Site,
        visiting the Site, purchasing products or services from COMPANY or the
        Site, or otherwise using the Site, please note that any personally
        identifiable information that you provide to COMPANY may be transferred
        to or utilized by COMPANY or its affiliates in the United States.
        &nbsp;Any such personally identifiable information provided may be
        processed and stored in the United States by COMPANY or a service
        provider acting on its behalf. &nbsp;

      <span>The Information COMPANY Collects</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        Users browsing the Site without registering an account or affirmatively
        providing personally identifiable information to COMPANY do so
        anonymously; however, certain non-personally identifying information is
        collected, as provided below. &nbsp;Users may provide and COMPANY may
        collect personally identifiable information from Users in a variety of
        ways. &nbsp;Personally identifiable information may include, without
        limitation, (i)&nbsp;contact data (such as a User&rsquo;s name, mailing
        and e-mail addresses); (ii)&nbsp;demographic data (such as a
        User&rsquo;s zip code or age)
      </span>
      <span>
        ; and (iii) other information requested during the account registration
        process (such as profession); and (v) specific favors requested by the
        User
      </span>
      <span>
        . &nbsp;COMPANY does not collect social security numbers. &nbsp;If you
        communicate with COMPANY by e-mail or otherwise, post User Content to
        the Site, post messages to any forums, complete online forms, surveys or
        entries, provide information outside of the account registration
        process, or otherwise interact with or uses the features on the Site,
        any information you provide may be collected by COMPANY. &nbsp;
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        COMPANY may also collect information about how Users use the Site, for
        example, by tracking the number of unique views received by the pages of
        the Site, or the domains and Internet Protocol (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;)
        addresses from which Users originate. &nbsp;While not all of the
        information that COMPANY collects from Users is personally identifiable,
        it may be associated with personally identifiable information that Users
        provide COMPANY through the Site or otherwise. &nbsp;Additionally,
        certain{" "}
      </span>
      <span>
        information regarding your computer systems, network locations, IP
        address and software may be communicated to COMPANY in certain
        circumstances by the digital rights management systems associated with
        certain Content that you download or access via the Site in order to
        prevent unauthorized use or distribution of the associated Content.
      </span>
      <span>
        &nbsp; Non-personally identifiable information collected by COMPANY
        (such as patterns of utilization) is exclusively owned by COMPANY and
        may be used as it sees fit in accordance with applicable law.

    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Cookies</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        Like most web sites, the Site uses cookies and web log files to track
        site usage. &nbsp;A cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your
        computer that allows COMPANY to recognize you as a User when you return
        to the Site using the same computer and web browser. &nbsp;Like the
        information you enter during account registration, cookie and log file
        data is used to customize your experience on the Site. &nbsp;One type of
        cookie, known as a &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; cookie, is set once you have
        logged in to your Site account. &nbsp;The next time you visit our Site,
        the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing User
        so you will not need to log in before using the Site. &nbsp;In order to
        access or change any of your private information, you must log in with
        your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie.
        &nbsp;Additionally, if you log out of the Site you will need to re-enter
        your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your
        account. &nbsp;Another type of cookie, called a &ldquo;session&rdquo;
        cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Site.
        &nbsp;Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your
        web browser. &nbsp;You can choose to disable cookies on your browser or
        allow your browser to notify you when a cookie is being sent, however
        this may prevent you from utilizing certain features of the Site. &nbsp;

      <span>IP Addresses </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        Due to the communications standards on the Internet, we automatically
        receive the uniform resource locator (URL) of the web site from which
        you came and the web site to which you proceed once you leave the Site.
        &nbsp;We also receive the IP address of your computer (or the proxy
        server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating
        system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of
        your Internet service provider (ISP). &nbsp;This information is used to
        analyze overall trends to help us improve the Site. &nbsp;The linkage
        between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is
        shared with third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Web Beacons and Ad Networks</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        We may allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve
        advertisements to Users via the Site. &nbsp;Ad networks include third
        party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.
        &nbsp;COMPANY may &ldquo;target&rdquo; some ads to Users that fit a
        certain general profile. &nbsp;To deliver these ads properly, the Site
        may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within
        pages served by the Site or implement other monitoring technologies so
        the networks may provide anonymous, aggregated auditing, research and
        reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you
        visit other web sites. &nbsp;These general targets may also be used by
        ad networks to display targeted ads on other web sites as a substitute
        for random, irrelevant ads. &nbsp;In addition, the Site may use the
        technology of ad networks to serve ads only when you visit this Site.
        &nbsp;Ad networks may use non-personal information, such as your state
        or zip code, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services
        that may be of particular interest to you while you visit this Site.
        &nbsp;Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web
        beacons from the ad network&rsquo;s servers, these companies can view,
        edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page
        from their site.
      </span>

    <p>
      <span>How COMPANY Uses Information</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        COMPANY may use personally identifiable information collected through
        the Site for the specific purposes for which the information was
        collected, to contact Users regarding Content, products and services
        offered by COMPANY, and otherwise to enhance Users&rsquo; experience
        with COMPANY. COMPANY may also use information collected through the
        Site for research regarding the effectiveness of the Site and the
        business planning, marketing, advertising and sales efforts of COMPANY,
        its trusted affiliates, independent contractors and business partners.
        &nbsp;Information collected from you may also be used to ensure
        compliance with certain terms and conditions and agreements entered
        between you and COMPANY as well as to prevent unauthorized use or
        disclosure of Content downloaded or otherwise accessed via the Site.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        COMPANY will communicate with you through email and notices posted on
        this Site. &nbsp;These may include a series of welcome emails which help
        inform new Users about various features of the Site, emails and
        confirmations regarding actions taken by you on the Site or Orders
        placed by you through the Site, and notices relating to the proper
        functioning of the Site or your account. COMPANY may use your personal
        information to send you promotional information relating to the Content,
        products and services offered by third parties that COMPANY feels may be
        of interest to you. &nbsp;
      </span>
      <span>
        The personal information you provide will allow us to alert you to new
        developments, new products, features and enhancements; special offers;
        upgrade opportunities; and surveys, contests and events of interest. We
        strive to limit use of the information you provide to those offers that
        we think you would appreciate receiving. To opt out of further
        communications from a marketing partner or sponsor with whom your
        information has been shared, please contact that partner directly. We
        may send COMPANY emails that may contain information regarding
        third-party products or services; however, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that
        we&rsquo;ve traded your personal information to any party.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Disclosure of Information</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        COMPANY may disclose personally identifiable information collected from
        Users to its parent, subsidiary and other related companies, trusted
        affiliates, independent contractors and business partners who will use
        the information for the purposes outlined above, as necessary to provide
        the services offered by the Site and the Site itself, and for the
        specific purposes for which the information was collected. &nbsp;COMPANY
        may disclose personally identifiable information at the request of law
        enforcement or governmental agencies or in response to subpoenas, court
        orders or other legal process, to establish, protect or exercise
        COMPANY&rsquo;s legal or other rights, to defend against a legal claim
        or as otherwise allowed by law. &nbsp;COMPANY may disclose personally
        identifiable information in order to protect the rights, property or
        safety of a User or any other person. &nbsp;COMPANY may disclose
        personally identifiable information to investigate or prevent a
        violation by User of any contractual or other relationship with COMPANY
        or where COMPANY has a good faith belief that access, preservation or
        disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to protect the
        rights, property or safety of COMPANY, its users or the public or the
        perpetration of any illegal or harmful activity. &nbsp;COMPANY may also
        disclose aggregate, anonymous data based on information collected from
        Users to Content developers, investors, advertisers and potential
        partners. &nbsp;Finally, COMPANY may disclose or transfer personally
        identifiable information collected from Users in connection with or in
        contemplation of a sale of its assets or business or a merger,
        consolidation or other reorganization of its business. &nbsp;
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        COMPANY may communicate or provide Users personal information to other
        selected persons (a) if the User consents to give
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Personal Information Provided as Part of User Content</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        If a User includes such User&rsquo;s personally identifiable information
        as part of the User Content that such User posts to the Site, such
        information may be made available to any parties using the Site and/or
        such User Content. &nbsp;COMPANY does not edit or otherwise remove such
        information from User Content before it is posted on the Site. &nbsp;If
        a User does not wish to have such User&rsquo;s personally identifiable
        information made available in this manner, such User must remove any
        such information from the User Content before posting. &nbsp;User
        contact information (which may include, without limitation, a
        User&rsquo;s username and email address) may be included with any User
        Content that a User posts via the Site. &nbsp;COMPANY is not liable for
        any damages caused or incurred due to personally identifiable
        information made available in the foregoing manners.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Security of Information</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        Information about Users that is maintained on COMPANY&rsquo;s systems is
        protected using industry standard security measures. &nbsp;In order to
        secure your personal information, access to your data is
        password-protected, and sensitive data is protected by SSL encryption
        when it is exchanged between your web browser and the Site.
        &nbsp;However, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and
        COMPANY cannot guarantee that the information submitted to, maintained
        on or transmitted from its systems will be completely secure.
        &nbsp;COMPANY is not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy
        settings or security measures contained on the Site by any Users or
        third parties.

    <p>
      <span>
        California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users that are residents
        of California to request certain information regarding COMPANY&rsquo;s
        disclosures of personally identifiable information to third parties for
        such third parties&rsquo; direct marketing purposes. &nbsp;If you are a

        Correcting, Updating, Accessing or Removing Personal Information
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        To the extent applicable, if a User&rsquo;s personally identifiable
        information changes (such as a User&rsquo;s zip code), or if a User no
        longer desires to receive non-account specific information from COMPANY,
        COMPANY will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update and/or remove
        that User&rsquo;s previously-provided personal data. &nbsp;This can be
        done by emailing a request to COMPANY at hello@favforme.com.
        &nbsp;Additionally, you may request access to the personally
        identifiable information as collected by COMPANY by sending a request to
        COMPANY as set forth above. &nbsp;Please note that in certain
        circumstances, COMPANY may not be able to completely remove a
        User&rsquo;s information from its systems. &nbsp;For example, COMPANY
        may retain a User&rsquo;s personal information for legitimate business
        purposes, if it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, for
        account recovery purposes, if required by law or as retained in
        COMPANY&rsquo;s data backup systems or cached or archived pages.
        &nbsp;All retained personally identifiable information will continue to
        be subject to the terms of the Privacy Policy to which the User has
        previously agreed.
